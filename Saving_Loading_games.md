The most important thing to understand to get this game to run properly is the loading/saving of the save files.

If there is no save_file.csv, the game will make one on the first save. It will instead read the new_game_stats.csv. To start over at any time, you can simply delete your local save_file.csv.

If neither .csv exists before running, the game will crash. I've provided backups of each in case this happens.

The game immediately looks at the file named "save_file.csv". The order of the values in this file is critical to save and load - any disruptions require a start over. You can ensure you don't lose your save data by making backups manually. Otherwise, you have to delete your save file and start over.
